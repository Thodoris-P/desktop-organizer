# desktop-organizer
A simple python script to take files from your Desktop and organize them 
according to their extension in your user folder (e.g. txt files go in Documents).

Only works on Linux. Support for other OSs is coming.
Currently only supports *.txt files

To use the programm simply download desktop-organizer.py and run it through the terminal (python interpreter needed).
It does not need any user input.
No GUI yet.
